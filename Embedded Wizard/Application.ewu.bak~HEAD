    /*

      HINT 1:

      This method is invoked automatically when the state set of the component has
      been changed. The new state set can be found in the parameter aState.
      Following are the important states:

        Enabled   --> The component can react to user inputs.

        Selected  --> The component is selected in context of its owner.

        Focused   --> The component is selected in context of its owner and 
                      the owner can react to keyboard events. In this manner the
                      component is also able to react to keyboard events.

        Modal     --> The component is modal. All events are redirected to this
                      component.

      To determine whether a state is currently active or not you have to test
      the aState parameter. For example to test the 'Selected' state:

        if ( aState.contains( Core::ViewState[ Selected ]))
        {
          ... yes, this component is currently selected.
        }

      HINT 2:

      Alternatively you can request this method invocation by executing explicitly
      following code:


        InvalidateViewState();

    */
      
    /*

      TO DO 1:

      Put here the code to ensure that the visual aspect of the component does
      reflect its current state. For example, depending on its 'Enabled' state
      a component may appear with full colors or pale if it is disabled:

        if ( aState.contains( Core::ViewState[ Enabled ]))
        {
          SomeBackgroundView.Opacity = 255;
          SomeTextView.Color         = #000000FF;
        }
        else
        {
          SomeBackgroundView.Opacity = 128;
          SomeTextView.Color         = #00000080;
        }


      TO DO 2:

      You can evaluate here also the state of any other member in your component.
      For example in a push-button component, the button should appear highlighted
      as long as the user holds the finger within a touch area of the button:

        if ( SomeTouchHandler.Down && SomeTouchHandler.Inside )
          HighlightedBackground.Visible = true;
        else
          HighlightedBackground.Visible = false;

      The touch handler itself only requests the update method to be called. Use
      for this purpose 'InvalidateViewState()' method.


      TO DO 3:

      You can calculate here also the position/size of views accordingly to the
      state of any other member in your component. For example in a slider you
      can calculate the position of the slider knob from some properties like
      'SliderValue' and 'SliderRange':

        SliderKnob.Bounds.origin.x = ( SliderValue * Bounds.w ) / SliderRange;

      Changing the 'SliderValue' or 'SliderRange' property should only request
      the update method to be called. Use for this purpose 'InvalidateViewState()'
      method.

      current (new) size of the component itself is passed in the parameter aSize.
      For example:

        SomeView.Bounds = rect( 10, 10, aSize.x - 20, aSize.y - 20 );

      This method is invoked automatically when the state set of the component has

      Following are the important states:

        Enabled   --> The component can react to user inputs.

           The variable 'thisObject' represents the actually initialized instance of the

           and use it whenever the middleware needs to notify the GUI application about
           some state alternation or events. In this manner, the middleware will be able
           to invoke methods of the interface device object.

           For example, you can store 'thisObject' in some global C variable:

             // Declaration of the global C variable
             XObject theDeviceObject;

             // Store the instance in the global variable

           Later use the global variable e.g. to provide the GUI application with events:

             ApplicationDeviceClass__TriggerSomeEvent( theDeviceObject );

           IMPORTANT:
           ----------

           If you store 'thisObject' for later use, don't forget to implement the opposite
           operation in the method 'Done'. Concrete, 'Done' should set the global variable
           again to the value NULL.

      This method is invoked automatically when the state set of the component has

      Following are the important states:

        Enabled   --> The component can react to user inputs.

        Selected  --> The component is selected in context of its owner.

  // - Adjust the visible size of your component (the thick blue border).
  // 
  // - The simplest way to compose the appearance of the component is to use the \
  // 'Views' and 'Widget Sets' from the Gallery.
  // 
  // - To react to touch or keyboard events use the templates from the Gallery folder \
  // 'Event Handlers'.
  // 
  // - To perform transitions (animations) use the templates from the Gallery folder \
  // 'Effects'.
  // 
  // - To implement the interface of the component use the 'Property' template from \
  // the Gallery folder 'Chora'.
  // 
  // - To store values use the 'Variable' and 'Array' templates available in the \
  // Gallery folder 'Chora'.
  // 
  // - To implement behavior use the 'Method' and 'Slot Method' templates available \
  // in the Gallery folder 'Chora'.
  // 
  // - In the method 'UpdateViewState()' you can put code to update the state of \
  // views enclosed in your component.
  // 
  // - In the method 'UpdateLayout()' you can put code to perform sophisticated layout \
  // calculation for enclosed views.
